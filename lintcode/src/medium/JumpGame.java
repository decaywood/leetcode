 *
 * Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *
 * Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
 *
 * Example
 * A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.
 *
 * A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.
 *
 * Note
 * This problem have two method which is Greedy and Dynamic Programming.
 *
 * The time complexity of Greedy method is O(n).
 *
 * The time complexity of Dynamic Programming method is O(n^2).
 *
 * We manually set the small data set to allow you pass the test in both ways.
 * This is just to let you learn how to use this problem in dynamic programming ways.
 * If you finish it in dynamic programming ways, you can try greedy method to make it accept again.
